# Fraud_detection 
I have applied Machine learning and ANN technicks in order to detect frauding activity with credit card use
The csv file is in the Kaggle.- https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. It is not uploaded due to it's size.

The model achieves a recall rate for class=1 (Fraud Case) equal to 81%. It detects 81% of the fraudulent activity, additionally
85% of the detected fraudulent activity is Fraudulent indeed (True Positives/(True Positives+False Positives).
